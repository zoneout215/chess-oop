## 🔄 Fork Information

This project is a fork of the original chess game created by [Sergey Zhukov](https://github.com/zhukovsd/chess). The base game logic and structure have been preserved, with additional enhancements made to specific chess moves.

## 🚀 Extended Functionality
### Castling 

The castling mechanism has been refined to provide a smoother experience. Both kingside and queenside castling are now more clearly indicated and easier to perform.

### En Passant

The en passant move has been implemented with additional visual cues and improved logic. This special pawn capture can now be executed more intuitively.
