# Enhanced Chess Game

This repository contains an enhanced version of a chess game, forked from [Original Owner's Repository](https://github.com/original-owner/chess-game). While the core functionality remains the same, this version includes extended features for en passant and castling moves.

## 🔄 Fork Information

This project is a fork of the original chess game created by [Original Owner]. The base game logic and structure have been preserved, with additional enhancements made to specific chess moves.

## 🚀 Extended Functionality

### En Passant

The en passant move has been implemented with additional visual cues and improved logic. This special pawn capture can now be executed more intuitively.

The castling mechanism has been refined to provide a smoother experience. Both kingside and queenside castling are now more clearly indicated and easier to perform.
